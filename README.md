## Description - Project 1:

The project focuses on controlling multiple robots using the simulation tool RobotStudio ABB. The robot on Table No. 1 will communicate with another robot on Table No. 2 using a conveyor belt. The main goal of the project will be to create a sorting production line. A more detailed description of the project will be discussed with the lecturer.

**Note 1:**
It will be possible to create your own production line design, but in accordance with certain principles!

**Note 2:**
It will be possible to create a team (max. 3 members), but with a reduction of the maximum score

## Description - Project 2:

The team project focuses mainly on the topic of robotic control using software such as Unity3D, ROS, Robot Studio ABB, B&R Automation Studio, and others. The team with a maximum of 3 to 4 members will create the appropriate robotic application and present the project in the last week of the semester. A more detailed description of individual projects will be discussed with the lecturer.

**Note:** 
It will be possible to create your own project theme, but in accordance with certain principles!
